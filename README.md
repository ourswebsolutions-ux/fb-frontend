# FB Marketplace Automation Suite — Desktop Frontend

Electron + React desktop application that is the control panel for the **FB Automation Backend** (FastAPI). It lets an operator manage Facebook accounts, generate and publish Marketplace listings with AI, run account warmup / slow-listing flows, and monitor background automation jobs in real time.

This app holds no automation logic itself — every action calls the FastAPI backend, which drives Playwright/Facebook and returns a `task_id` that the UI polls for progress.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- The FB Automation Backend running and reachable (defaults to `http://localhost:8000`)

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Starts the Vite dev server (port 5173) and Electron concurrently. The app opens with DevTools enabled.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Outputs:
- `dist/` — compiled React app
- `dist-electron/` — platform installer (`.exe` / `.dmg` / `.AppImage`)

---

## Backend Connection

- **Base URL** — read from `VITE_API_BASE_URL` at build time, overridable at runtime via `localStorage['fb_base_url']` (Settings screen), falling back to `http://localhost:8000`.
- **Auth** — `POST /api/auth/login` returns a JWT stored in `localStorage['access_token']`; it's attached as a `Bearer` header on every request and cleared automatically on a `401`. `App.jsx`'s `AuthGate` checks `/api/auth/me` on launch to decide whether to show the app or prompt for login.
- **Automation calls are async** — every feature page posts to `POST /api/automation/{name}` (see `src/utils/api.js`), which returns a `task_id` immediately. `TaskMonitor.jsx` polls `GET /api/tasks/{id}` every 2.5s and reports progress/status until the job leaves `queued`/`running`/`pending`.

## Feature Catalog

Defined in `src/config/features.js` and rendered by `Sidebar.jsx`:

| Section              | Features |
|----------------------|----------|
| Overview             | Dashboard, Activity Monitoring, Inbox, FB Accounts |
| Account Management   | Old Account Listings, New Account Slow Listings (v1/v2), Account Warm Up, Open FB Accounts, Profile Updater |
| Listing Management   | AI Ultra Listings (max 100), Create Only Drafts, AI Draft Publisher, Draft Publisher, Renew Listings, Relist Listings, Delete All Listings, X Draft Delete |
| Marketing Tools      | ADS Multiplier, Marketplace Click Tracking, Listing Automation |
| AI Features          | AI Title Generation, AI Description Creation, AI Content Optimization, AI Draft Creation, Smart Listing Suggestions, Automated Workflow Support |
| System               | Settings |

---

## Security Model

- **contextIsolation: true** — renderer cannot access Node.js APIs directly
- **nodeIntegration: false** — no direct Node in renderer
- **preload.js whitelist** — only explicitly allowed IPC channels are exposed to the renderer (window controls; see legacy note below)
- **CSP** — `connect-src` is locked to `localhost` in development and the configured production API host in packaged builds

---

## Legacy Code (not part of the current app)

This project was bootstrapped from an earlier WhatsApp-bulk-sender Electron template, and some of that scaffolding is still present but **unused**:

- `electron/main/whatsapp.js`, `electron/main/database.js` — Baileys/SQLite services
- The `wa:*`, `contacts:*`, and `settings:get`/`settings:save` IPC channels in `electron/main/index.js` / `electron/preload/index.js`
- `package.json`'s `name`, `description`, and `build.appId`/`build.productName`/`build.publish` still say "whatsapp-automated"

No component in `src/` calls any of the `wa:*`/`contacts:*`/`settings:*` channels — all real data flows through `src/utils/api.js` over HTTPS to the FastAPI backend. Safe to remove once confirmed, but left untouched here since that wasn't the scope of this change.

---

## Platform Support

| Platform | Format      | Notes                                 |
|----------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| Windows  | NSIS `.exe` / portable | Requires Visual C++ Build Tools |
| macOS    | `.dmg`      | Requires Xcode CLI Tools              |
| Linux    | `.AppImage` / `.deb` | No install needed, self-contained |
